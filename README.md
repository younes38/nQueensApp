# nQueensApp

A mobile application that gives you all the possible solutions for the famous n-Queens problem.

## what is the n-Queens problem ?
-  The n-Queens is the problem of placing n chess queens on an n√ón chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
-  This problem is a NP-complete problem.

## How does it work ?
I solved the problem using a brute force algorithm with some optimizations which are:
-  We use an array of n elements instead of using nxn arrays.
-  Whenever we find a case where two queens attack each other we stop that case.
